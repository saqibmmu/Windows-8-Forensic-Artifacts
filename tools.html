<h2>Forensic Tools for Windows 8</h2>
<div class="tools">
<h2>Encase</h2>
<p>This is one of the most popular tool a lot of investigator tend to use when imaging a file or finding evidence. 
Encase can be used in any file system where a servlet has been developed such as Windows, Linux, AIX, OSX and Solaris. 
The software uses the most advanced and easy tools to use to carry out tasks that are time consuming and complicated.
 Advantage of this software is that there is an international language support which means that the investigators can you use Unicode data decoding.
 This will then let them you use any language that the Unicode supports.
The disadvantage is that it crashes when you are searching corrupt pictures and it only does live searches.</p>
</div>

<div class="tools">
<h2>Pro Discover Basic</h2>
<p>
  This software is a basic digital forensic investigation tool and this allows the user to make an image, 
  analyse and report on any evidence found. After you have added an image,
  you can look through it by looking into the clusters that hold the data. To search data you can use the search node based on what you are searching. 
  The advantage of this tool is that is a basic tool so it will be easy for a user to use and it does not cost as much. It is easy to create hash set of files, cases are easily set up and images can be compressed.
  The disadvantage is that when the remote system is imaged the user might need a password and use the Twofish encryption but it will leave the local binary open to exploit and it will be easy for a hacker to hack into it.
.</p>
</div>

<div class="tools">
<h2>FTK Imager</h2>
<p>FTK imager is an imaging tool, which allows the user to examine file and folders on local hard drives, CD’s, network drives and review the content of forensic images. 
 You can create SHA1 or MD5 hashes of files, recover and review files that have been deleted from the recycle bin and export files and folders from forensic images to disks. 
 The advantage of the FTK is that it has been around for more than 20 years and it is quite difficult with making new software. 
 The greatest strength it has is that it has vision, creativity and drive. Another advantage is that it has an Access Data strategy and this is the view of digital forensic data.
 The disadvantage of it is that it you are only allow 2 million file limit, no multitasking, no scripting support and no progress bar.</p>
</div>



<div class="tools">
<h2>Volatility</h2>
<p>This is a memory forensic framework for incident response and malware analysis and it will allow you to extract digital artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) dumps. You can extract information about running processes, network connections and cached registry hives etc. The advantage of volatility is that you can recover user passwords and use cryptographic keys that can decrypt files from the user account. The disadvantage of the user should have knowledge of how to acquire the memory.
These are the software tools that are available in windows 8. To use these you will need to download them or install them and make your way through them.
