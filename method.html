<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>The first steps will be to confirm that if there has been an incident. The investigator will need to scope and determine the case and to check the situations, what the situation is and the nature of the case. 
This step is important for the investigator because it will help them identify the characteristics of the incident and to see what the best approach will be to identify, preserve and collect evidence.</p>
</div>

<div class="tools">
<h2> String and Byte Search</h2>
<p>
  If the investigator knows what they are looking for then they can use this tool to search low-level raw images. The byte search is used to look at byte signatures of files that is known as the magic cookies. The String search is used to search regular expressions. 
  The byte and string signatures should be the ones that the investigator thinks it will be important for the case they are dealing with.

<h2>Data Recovery</h2>
<p>This step is done to recover data that has been lost from the file system. To find the files that will be an interest to the investigator will be found by analysing the slack space, unallocated space and in depth file system. The sleuth kit can be used to analyse the file system, metadata layer and data layer. 
To gather more evidence they can find raw images and find headers using the tools such as foremost.</p>

<div class="tools">
<h2>Digital Evidence</h2>
<p>Digital Evidence is a guide to show a first time user how to collect and preserve electronic evidence. 
Electronic evidence is stored or transmitted by an electronic device. When collecting electronic evidence the investigator should know that the evidence is fragile and it can easily be damaged and destroyed, thatâ€™s why the investigator should take precautions when examining and documenting evidence. The first part of the guidelines will include the electronic devices used in crime scene, description on each type of device used. The second part should include a list of investigation tools and equipment that has been used to collect electronic evidence. The third part will be focusing on securing and evaluating a crime scene, which will show outlines of necessary steps to ensure safety of people who are there at the scene and protecting the integrity of evidence. The fourth part is to provide the investigator with guidelines on how to document the scene and this will be a record of the scene. The next part is how the investigator can collect non-electronic evidence and computers in a busy environment.
 The final part will be the packaging, transporting and storage of the evidence.
